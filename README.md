# Captions for X Theme

This is a simple WordPress plugin that will add captions underneath featured images when using the X Theme. There is no text alignment specified, so they should left-align by default. This can be changed in the plugin code.

# Requirements
You must be using the X Theme on your WordPress website, and must use a custom field titled "caption" to insert the caption text. You can tweak the code accordingly to change this, however.
